This project is an assignment that illustrates the user-friendliness and accessibility of a webpage using only HTML (no CSS and no JavaScript).

A single HTML file named index.html. It should include:
1.	A semantic structure using appropriate HTML5 elements.
2.	Clear headings in a logical hierarchy.
3.	Accessibility enhancements using proper tags and attributes.
4.	SEO-friendly metadata and content.

NOTE: 
In a descending format, I made use of the headings elements/tags from <h1> to <h6>.
From observance of the topic headings, the change is quite noticable.
